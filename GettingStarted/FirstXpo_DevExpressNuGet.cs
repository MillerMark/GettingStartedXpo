		Now that the Package Manager is up, let's create a new vertical

											   vertical tab group.


		Click the Browse tab:
		![](ClickBrowse)
	  
		Search for "DevExpress.Xpo"﻿. ![](Copy;crcommand:CopyToClipboard:"DevExpress.Xpo";;0.01200,0.01200)

		
		Select the DevExpress.Xpo package, 
		and click Install:

		![](DevExpressXpoClickInstall;;;0.02397,0.02397)
